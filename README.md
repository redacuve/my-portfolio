<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
## How it Works

It is built with react, inside the src folder is everything, index.js is the main file, it uses the index.html located inside the public folder, inside src are three folders, one folder contains the assets of the page (images), the pages folder has 3 pages inside Homepage, Contacpage, and Resumepage, and the components are located inside components folder, I created that components to be easy to maintain, feel free to take any of the components.

### Running the code

*   Navigate to the root directory of the project

*   Run this command on your terminal to run the code locally on http://localhost:3000:
    ```
    $ npm start
    ```
*   Also you can build this app for production, react are going to make a build folder with minified files, and filenames with hashes for best performance
    ```
    $ npm build
    ```
*   You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

* To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
